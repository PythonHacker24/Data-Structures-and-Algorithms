## System Design Classics

Design a URL Shortener (like bit.ly) - Tests database design, caching, and scalability concepts. Focus on URL encoding, collision handling, and expiration policies.
Design a Chat System - Covers real-time communication, message storage, user presence, and notification systems. Consider WebSocket connections and message ordering.
Design a Rate Limiter - Examines algorithm knowledge (token bucket, sliding window), distributed systems, and performance optimization.
Design a Parking Lot System - Object-oriented design focused on inheritance, polymorphism, and state management for different vehicle types and parking spots.

## Data Structure & Algorithm Heavy

Design a Cache System (LRU/LFU) - Tests understanding of hash maps, doubly linked lists, and cache eviction policies.
Design a File System - Involves tree structures, path resolution, and file operations with proper error handling.
Design an In-Memory Database - Covers indexing, query processing, transaction handling, and memory management.

## Real-World Applications

Design a Notification System - Multi-channel delivery (email, SMS, push), priority queuing, and retry mechanisms.
Design a Library Management System - Classic OOP design with user roles, book inventory, borrowing workflows, and fine calculations.
Design a Ride Sharing Service (Driver-Rider matching) - Location-based services, matching algorithms, and state machines for trip lifecycle.
Design a Food Delivery System - Restaurant management, order processing, delivery tracking, and payment integration.

## Technical Deep Dives

Design a Load Balancer - Algorithm implementation (round-robin, weighted), health checks, and failover mechanisms.
Design a Search Engine - Indexing strategies, ranking algorithms, and query processing optimization.
Design a Logging System - Log levels, formatting, rotation policies, and distributed log aggregation.
