## Overview

Rate limiting is a critical component in distributed systems that controls the rate of requests sent or received by a service. This implementation provides multiple algorithms commonly used in production systems, designed with Object-Oriented Programming principles and thread safety considerations.

### Problem Statement

Design a rate limiter that can:
- Handle different rate limiting strategies
- Support multiple users concurrently
- Be thread-safe and performant
- Scale to distributed environments
- Provide flexibility for different use cases

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Token Bucket Algorithm

**Concept**: A bucket holds tokens that are consumed by requests. Tokens are refilled at a constant rate.

**Use Cases**: 
- API rate limiting with burst allowance
- Network traffic shaping
- Resource allocation in cloud services

**Characteristics**:
- Allows burst traffic up to bucket capacity
- Smooth token refill rate
- Memory efficient: O(1) per user

### 2. Sliding Window Log Algorithm

**Concept**: Maintains a log of request timestamps and removes entries outside the time window.

**Use Cases**:
- Precise rate limiting requirements
- Audit and compliance scenarios
- Fine-grained access control

**Characteristics**:
- Most accurate algorithm
- Higher memory usage: O(requests_in_window)
- Exact request counting

### 3. Sliding Window Counter Algorithm

**Concept**: Divides the time window into smaller buckets and maintains counters for each bucket.

**Use Cases**:
- Balance between accuracy and efficiency
- High-throughput systems
- Approximate rate limiting

**Characteristics**:
- Good approximation with configurable precision
- Memory efficient: O(bucket_count)
- Weighted calculation for smooth sliding

## System Architecture

### Core Components

```
RateLimiterInterface (Abstract)
    ├── TokenBucketRateLimiter
    ├── SlidingWindowRateLimiter
    └── SlidingWindowCounterRateLimiter

RateLimiterFactory (Static)
    └── Creates instances of rate limiters

DistributedRateLimiterManager
    └── Manages multiple rate limiters with different policies
```

### Design Patterns Applied

- **Strategy Pattern**: Different algorithms with same interface
- **Factory Pattern**: Centralized creation of rate limiter instances
- **Template Method**: Common structure with algorithm-specific implementations
- **Composition**: Manager class containing multiple rate limiters

## Implementation Details

### Thread Safety

All implementations use `threading.Lock` to ensure thread safety:
- Atomic operations on shared data structures
- Consistent state during concurrent access
- Prevention of race conditions

### Memory Management

- **Token Bucket**: Fixed memory per user (bucket state)
- **Sliding Window Log**: Variable memory based on request frequency
- **Sliding Window Counter**: Fixed memory per user (bucket array)

### Time Handling

- Uses `time.time()` for timestamp generation
- Handles clock drift and system time changes
- Supports configurable time windows and refresh periods

## Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity

| Algorithm | Per Request | Memory Cleanup |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Token Bucket | O(1) | O(1) |
| Sliding Window Log | O(1) amortized | O(n) |
| Sliding Window Counter | O(1) | O(k) |

Where n = requests in window, k = number of buckets

### Space Complexity

| Algorithm | Per User | Total System |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Token Bucket | O(1) | O(users) |
| Sliding Window Log | O(requests) | O(users × requests) |
| Sliding Window Counter | O(buckets) | O(users × buckets) |

### Throughput Characteristics

- **Token Bucket**: High throughput, best for burst handling
- **Sliding Window Log**: Moderate throughput, highest accuracy
- **Sliding Window Counter**: High throughput, good accuracy

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

### Token Bucket vs Sliding Window

| Aspect | Token Bucket | Sliding Window |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Accuracy | Moderate | High |
| Memory Usage | Low | High |
| Burst Handling | Excellent | Limited |
| Implementation Complexity | Simple | Moderate |
| Distributed Sync | Easy | Complex |

### Counter vs Log Approach

**Sliding Window Log**:
- Pros: Exact counting, audit trail
- Cons: High memory usage, cleanup overhead

**Sliding Window Counter**:
- Pros: Fixed memory, efficient computation
- Cons: Approximate results, configuration complexity

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
# Create rate limiters
token_bucket = RateLimiterFactory.create_token_bucket(capacity=10, refill_rate=5)
sliding_window = RateLimiterFactory.create_sliding_window_log(max_requests=100, window_size=3600)

# Check requests
if token_bucket.is_allowed("user123"):
    # Process request
    pass
else:
    # Reject request
    pass
```

### Distributed Management

```python
# Setup multiple policies
manager = DistributedRateLimiterManager()
manager.add_limiter("api_limit", token_bucket_limiter)
manager.add_limiter("user_limit", sliding_window_limiter)

# Check against all policies
if manager.is_allowed_by_all("user123"):
    # All policies allow
    pass
```

## Interview Questions & Answers

### Q: How would you handle distributed rate limiting?

**A**: Several approaches:
1. **Centralized Store**: Use Redis with atomic operations (INCR, EXPIRE)
2. **Distributed Consensus**: Implement using consistent hashing
3. **Eventually Consistent**: Allow slight over-limit with sync mechanisms
4. **Sticky Sessions**: Route users to same servers

### Q: How do you handle clock synchronization issues?

**A**: 
1. Use logical clocks or vector clocks instead of wall-clock time
2. Implement clock drift detection and adjustment
3. Add tolerance margins for distributed coordination
4. Use centralized time service for critical applications

### Q: What happens during high load scenarios?

**A**:
1. **Circuit Breaker**: Fail-fast when rate limiter itself becomes bottleneck
2. **Async Processing**: Queue rate limit checks for non-critical paths
3. **Approximate Algorithms**: Trade accuracy for performance
4. **Local Caching**: Cache decisions temporarily

### Q: How would you test rate limiters?

**A**:
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual algorithms with controlled time
2. **Load Testing**: Simulate concurrent requests with known patterns  
3. **Property-Based Testing**: Verify invariants across different inputs
4. **Chaos Testing**: Inject failures and verify graceful degradation

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

**Challenges**:
- State synchronization across instances
- Network latency affecting decisions
- Consistency vs availability trade-offs

**Solutions**:
- Sharding users across rate limiter instances
- Using distributed data stores (Redis Cluster)
- Implementing eventual consistency models

### Vertical Scaling

**Optimizations**:
- Memory pooling for frequent allocations
- Batch processing of rate limit checks
- Efficient data structures (ring buffers, bloom filters)

### Edge Cases

- **Time Drift**: Handle system clock changes
- **Cold Start**: Initialize rate limiters for new users
- **Memory Pressure**: Implement LRU eviction policies
- **Network Partitions**: Graceful degradation strategies

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage

- **Functional Tests**: Verify algorithm correctness
- **Concurrency Tests**: Multi-threaded access patterns
- **Performance Tests**: Measure latency and throughput
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end system behavior

### Validation Metrics

- **False Positive Rate**: Legitimate requests rejected
- **False Negative Rate**: Invalid requests allowed
- **Latency**: Time to make rate limiting decision
- **Memory Usage**: Resource consumption patterns

### Monitoring and Observability

Key metrics to track:
- Request allow/deny rates
- Rate limiter latency percentiles
- Memory usage per user/algorithm
- Error rates and system health
